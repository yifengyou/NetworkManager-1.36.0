<p>
      NetworkManager-dispatcher service is a D-Bus activated service that
      runs user provided scripts upon certain changes in NetworkManager.
    </p>
<p>
      NetworkManager-dispatcher will execute scripts in the
      <code class="filename">/{etc,usr/lib}/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d</code>
      directory or subdirectories in
      alphabetical order in response to network events.  Each script should
      be a regular executable file owned by root.  Furthermore, it must not be
      writable by group or other, and not setuid.
    </p>
<p>
      Each script receives two arguments, the first being the interface name of the
      device an operation just happened on, and second the action. For device actions,
      the interface is the name of the kernel interface suitable for IP configuration.
      Thus it is either VPN_IP_IFACE, DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or DEVICE_IFACE, as applicable.
      For the <code class="varname">hostname</code> action the device name is always <code class="literal">"none"</code>
      and for <code class="varname">connectivity-change</code> it is empty.
    </p>
<p>The actions are:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><table border="0" class="variablelist">
<colgroup>
<col align="left" valign="top">
<col>
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><span class="term"><code class="varname">pre-up</code></span></p></td>
<td><p>The interface is connected to the network but is not
        yet fully activated.  Scripts acting on this event must be placed or
        symlinked into the <code class="filename">/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-up.d</code>
        directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before
        indicating to applications that the interface is fully activated.
        </p></td>

        placed or symlinked into the <code class="filename">/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/pre-down.d</code>
        directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete
        before disconnecting the interface from its network.  Note that this
        event is not emitted for forced disconnections, like when carrier is
        lost or a wireless signal fades.  It is only emitted when there is
        an opportunity to cleanly handle a network disconnection event.

<p>
      In case of VPN, VPN_IP_IFACE is set, and IP4_*, IP6_* variables with VPN prefix are
      exported too, like VPN_IP4_ADDRESS_0, VPN_IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES.
    </p>
<p>
      Dispatcher scripts are run one at a time, but asynchronously from the main
      NetworkManager process, and will be killed if they run for too long. If your script
      might take arbitrarily long to complete, you should spawn a child process and have the
      parent return immediately. Scripts that are symbolic links pointing inside the
      <code class="filename">/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/no-wait.d/</code>
      directory are run immediately, without
      waiting for the termination of previous scripts, and in parallel. Also beware that
      once a script is queued, it will always be run, even if a later event renders it
      obsolete. (Eg, if an interface goes up, and then back down again quickly, it is
      possible that one or more "up" scripts will be run after the interface has gone down.)
