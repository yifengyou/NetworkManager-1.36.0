.SH "NAME"
nm-online \- ask NetworkManager whether the network is connected
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBnm\-online\fR\ 'u
\fBnm\-online\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnm\-online\fR
is a utility to find out whether we are online\&. It is done by asking NetworkManager about its status\&. When run,
\fBnm\-online\fR
waits until NetworkManager reports an active connection, or specified timeout expires\&. On exit, the returned status code should be checked (see the return codes below)\&.
.PP
This tool is not very useful to call directly\&. It is however used by
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
with
\-\-wait\-for\-startup
argument\&. This is used to delay the service and indirectly
network\-online\&.target, until networking is up\&. Don\*(Aqt order your own systemd services after
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
directly\&. Instead if necessary, order your services after
network\-online\&.target\&. Even better is to have your services react to network changes dynamically and don\*(Aqt order them with respect to
network\-online\&.target
at all\&.
.PP
By default, connections have the
ipv4\&.may\-fail
and
ipv6\&.may\-fail
properties set to
yes; this means that NetworkManager waits for one of the two address families to complete configuration before considering the connection activated\&. If you need a specific address family configured before
network\-online\&.target
is reached, set the corresponding
may\-fail
property to
no\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h\fR | \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print help information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR | \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Don\*(Aqt print anything\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR | \fB\-\-wait\-for\-startup\fR
.RS 4
Wait for NetworkManager startup to complete, rather than waiting for network connectivity specifically\&. Startup is considered complete once NetworkManager has activated (or attempted to activate) every auto\-activate connection which is available given the current network state\&. This corresponds to the moment when NetworkManager logs
"startup complete"\&. This mode is generally only useful at boot time\&. After startup has completed,
\fBnm\-online \-s\fR
will just return immediately, regardless of the current network state\&.
.sp
There are various ways to affect when startup complete is reached\&. For example, by setting a connection profile to autoconnect, such a profile possibly will activate during startup and thus delay startup complete being reached\&. Also, a profile is considered ready when it fully reached the logical
connected
state in NetworkManager\&. That means, properties like
ipv4\&.may\-fail
and
ipv6\&.may\-fail
affect whether a certain address family is required\&. Also, the connection property
connection\&.wait\-device\-timeout
affects whether to wait for the driver to detect a certain device\&. Generally, a failure of
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
indicates a configuration error, where NetworkManager won\*(Aqt be able to reach the desired connectivity state during startup\&. An example for that are bridge or bond master profiles, that get autoconnected but without activating any slaves\&. Such master devices hang in activating state indefinitely, and cause
NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service
to fail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t\fR | \fB\-\-timeout\fR \fIseconds\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait for a connection, in seconds\&. If the option is not provided, the environment variable
NM_ONLINE_TIMEOUT
is honored\&. The default timeout is 30 seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR | \fB\-\-exit\fR
.RS 4
Exit immediately if NetworkManager is not running or connecting\&.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
\fBnm\-online\fR
exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is returned if an error occurs\&.
.PP
\fB0\fR
.RS 4
Success \(en already online or connection established within given timeout\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB1\fR
.RS 4
Offline or not online within given timeout\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB2\fR
.RS 4
Unknown or unspecified error\&.
