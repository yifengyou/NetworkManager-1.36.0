.SH "NAME"
nm-settings-nmcli \- Description of settings and properties of NetworkManager connection profiles for nmcli
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles, sometimes referred to as connections only\&. These connection profiles contain a network configuration\&. When NetworkManager activates a connection profile on a network device the configuration will be applied and an active network connection will be established\&. Users are free to create as many connection profiles as they see fit\&. Thus they are flexible in having various network configurations for different networking needs\&.
.PP
NetworkManager provides an API for configuring connection profiles, for activating them to configure the network, and inspecting the current network configuration\&. The command line tool
\fInmcli\fR
is a client application to NetworkManager that uses this API\&. See
\fBnmcli\fR(1)
for details\&.
.PP
With commands like
nmcli connection add,
nmcli connection modify
and
nmcli connection show, connection profiles can be created, modified and inspected\&. A profile consists of properties\&. On D\-Bus this follows the format as described by
\fBnm-settings-dbus\fR(5), while this manual page describes the settings format how they are expected by
\fInmcli\fR\&.
.PP
The settings and properties shown in tables below list all available connection configuration options\&. However, note that not all settings are applicable to all connection types\&.
\fInmcli\fR
connection editor has also a built\-in
\fIdescribe\fR
command that can display description of particular settings and properties of this page\&.
.PP
The
\fIsetting\fR
and
\fIproperty\fR
can be abbreviated provided they are unique\&. The list below also shows aliases that can be used unqualified instead of the full name\&. For example
connection\&.interface\-name
and
ifname
refer to the same property\&.
.SS "connection setting"
.PP
General Connection Profile Settings\&.
.PP
Properties:
.PP
\fBauth\-retries\fR
.RS 4
The number of retries for the authentication\&. Zero means to try indefinitely; \-1 means to use a global default\&. If the global default is not set, the authentication retries for 3 times before failing the connection\&. Currently, this only applies to 802\-1x authentication\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBautoconnect\fR
.RS 4
Alias: autoconnect
.sp
Whether or not the connection should be automatically connected by NetworkManager when the resources for the connection are available\&. TRUE to automatically activate the connection, FALSE to require manual intervention to activate the connection\&. Autoconnect happens when the circumstances are suitable\&. That means for example that the device is currently managed and not active\&. Autoconnect thus never replaces or competes with an already active profile\&. Note that autoconnect is not implemented for VPN profiles\&. See "secondaries" as an alternative to automatically connect VPN profiles\&.
.sp
Format: boolean
.RE
.PP
\fBautoconnect\-priority\fR
.RS 4
The autoconnect priority in range \-999 to 999\&. If the connection is set to autoconnect, connections with higher priority will be preferred\&. The higher number means higher priority\&. Defaults to 0\&. Note that this property only matters if there are more than one candidate profile to select for autoconnect\&. In case of equal priority, the profile used most recently is chosen\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBautoconnect\-retries\fR
.RS 4
The number of times a connection should be tried when autoactivating before giving up\&. Zero means forever, \-1 means the global default (4 times if not overridden)\&. Setting this to 1 means to try activation only once before blocking autoconnect\&. Note that after a timeout, NetworkManager will try to autoconnect again\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBautoconnect\-slaves\fR
.RS 4
Whether or not slaves of this connection should be automatically brought up when NetworkManager activates this connection\&. This only has a real effect for master connections\&. The properties "autoconnect", "autoconnect\-priority" and "autoconnect\-retries" are unrelated to this setting\&. The permitted values are: 0: leave slave connections untouched, 1: activate all the slave connections with this connection, \-1: default\&. If \-1 (default) is set, global connection\&.autoconnect\-slaves is read to determine the real value\&. If it is default as well, this fallbacks to 0\&.
.sp
Format: NMSettingConnectionAutoconnectSlaves (int32)
.RE
.PP
\fBdns\-over\-tls\fR
.RS 4
Whether DNSOverTls (dns\-over\-tls) is enabled for the connection\&. DNSOverTls is a technology which uses TLS to encrypt dns traffic\&. The permitted values are: "yes" (2) use DNSOverTls and disabled fallback, "opportunistic" (1) use DNSOverTls but allow fallback to unencrypted resolution, "no" (0) don\*(Aqt ever use DNSOverTls\&. If unspecified "default" depends on the plugin used\&. Systemd\-resolved uses global setting\&. This feature requires a plugin which supports DNSOverTls\&. Otherwise, the setting has no effect\&. One such plugin is dns\-systemd\-resolved\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBgateway\-ping\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
If greater than zero, delay success of IP addressing until either the timeout is reached, or an IP gateway replies to a ping\&.
.sp
Format: uint32
.RE
.PP
\fBid\fR
.RS 4
Alias: con\-name
.sp
A human readable unique identifier for the connection, like "Work Wi\-Fi" or "T\-Mobile 3G"\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBinterface\-name\fR
.RS 4
Alias: ifname
.sp
The name of the network interface this connection is bound to\&. If not set, then the connection can be attached to any interface of the appropriate type (subject to restrictions imposed by other settings)\&. For software devices this specifies the name of the created device\&. For connection types where interface names cannot easily be made persistent (e\&.g\&. mobile broadband or USB Ethernet), this property should not be used\&. Setting this property restricts the interfaces a connection can be used with, and if interface names change or are reordered the connection may be applied to the wrong interface\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBlldp\fR
.RS 4
Whether LLDP is enabled for the connection\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBllmnr\fR
.RS 4
Whether Link\-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is enabled for the connection\&. LLMNR is a protocol based on the Domain Name System (DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link\&. The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving for the connection, "no" (0) disable LLMNR for the interface, "resolve" (1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of LLMNR host names If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for systemd\-resolved currently means "yes")\&. This feature requires a plugin which supports LLMNR\&. Otherwise, the setting has no effect\&. One such plugin is dns\-systemd\-resolved\&.
.sp

\fBmaster\fR
.RS 4
Alias: master
.sp
Interface name of the master device or UUID of the master connection\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBmdns\fR
.RS 4
Whether mDNS is enabled for the connection\&. The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving for the connection, "no" (0) disable mDNS for the interface, "resolve" (1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of mDNS host names and "default" (\-1) to allow lookup of a global default in NetworkManager\&.conf\&. If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for systemd\-resolved currently means "no")\&. This feature requires a plugin which supports mDNS\&. Otherwise, the setting has no effect\&. One such plugin is dns\-systemd\-resolved\&.
.sp

.PP
\fBmud\-url\fR
.RS 4
If configured, set to a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URL that points to manufacturer\-recommended network policies for IoT devices\&. It is transmitted as a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 option\&. The value must be a valid URL starting with "https://"\&. The special value "none" is allowed to indicate that no MUD URL is used\&. If the per\-profile value is unspecified (the default), a global connection default gets consulted\&. If still unspecified, the ultimate default is "none"\&.

.RE
.PP
\fBpermissions\fR
.RS 4
An array of strings defining what access a given user has to this connection\&. If this is NULL or empty, all users are allowed to access this connection; otherwise users are allowed if and only if they are in this list\&. When this is not empty, the connection can be active only when one of the specified users is logged into an active session\&. Each entry is of the form "[type]:[id]:[reserved]"; for example, "user:dcbw:blah"\&. At this time only the "user" [type] is allowed\&. Any other values are ignored and reserved for future use\&. [id] is the username that this permission refers to, which may not contain the ":" character\&. Any [reserved] information present must be ignored and is reserved for future use\&. All of [type], [id], and [reserved] must be valid UTF\-8\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBread\-only\fR

.PP
\fBslave\-type\fR
.RS 4
Alias: slave\-type
.sp
Setting name of the device type of this slave\*(Aqs master connection (eg, "bond"), or NULL if this connection is not a slave\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBstable\-id\fR
.RS 4
This represents the identity of the connection used for various purposes\&. It allows to configure multiple profiles to share the identity\&. Also, the stable\-id can contain placeholders that are substituted dynamically and deterministically depending on the context\&. The stable\-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6\&.addr\-gen\-mode=stable\-privacy\&. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for ethernet\&.cloned\-mac\-address=stable and wifi\&.cloned\-mac\-address=stable\&. It is also used as DHCP client identifier with ipv4\&.dhcp\-client\-id=stable and to derive the DHCP DUID with ipv6\&.dhcp\-duid=stable\-[llt,ll,uuid]\&. Note that depending on the context where it is used, other parameters are also seeded into the generation algorithm\&. For example, a per\-host key is commonly also included, so that different systems end up generating different IDs\&. Or with ipv6\&.addr\-gen\-mode=stable\-privacy, also the device\*(Aqs name is included, so that different interfaces yield different addresses\&. The per\-host key is the identity of your machine and stored in /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret\-key\&. The \*(Aq$\*(Aq character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions at runtime\&. Currently, supported are "${CONNECTION}", "${DEVICE}", "${MAC}", "${BOOT}", "${RANDOM}"\&. These effectively create unique IDs per\-connection, per\-device, per\-boot, or every time\&. Note that "${DEVICE}" corresponds to the interface name of the device and "${MAC}" is the permanent MAC address of the device\&. Any unrecognized patterns following \*(Aq$\*(Aq are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use\&. You are thus advised to avoid \*(Aq$\*(Aq or escape it as "$$"\&. For example, set it to "${CONNECTION}\-${BOOT}\-${DEVICE}" to create a unique id for this connection that changes with every reboot and differs depending on the interface where the profile activates\&. If the value is unset, a global connection default is consulted\&. If the value is still unset, the default is similar to "${CONNECTION}" and uses a unique, fixed ID for the connection\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBtimestamp\fR
.RS 4
The time, in seconds since the Unix Epoch, that the connection was last _successfully_ fully activated\&. NetworkManager updates the connection timestamp periodically when the connection is active to ensure that an active connection has the latest timestamp\&. The property is only meant for reading (changes to this property will not be preserved)\&.
.sp
Format: uint64
.RE
.PP
\fBtype\fR
.RS 4
Alias: type
.sp
Base type of the connection\&. For hardware\-dependent connections, should contain the setting name of the hardware\-type specific setting (ie, "802\-3\-ethernet" or "802\-11\-wireless" or "bluetooth", etc), and for non\-hardware dependent connections like VPN or otherwise, should contain the setting name of that setting type (ie, "vpn" or "bridge", etc)\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBuuid\fR
.RS 4
A universally unique identifier for the connection, for example generated with libuuid\&. It should be assigned when the connection is created, and never changed as long as the connection still applies to the same network\&. For example, it should not be changed when the "id" property or NMSettingIP4Config changes, but might need to be re\-created when the Wi\-Fi SSID, mobile broadband network provider, or "type" property changes\&. The UUID must be in the format "2815492f\-7e56\-435e\-b2e9\-246bd7cdc664" (ie, contains only hexadecimal characters and "\-")\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBwait\-device\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
Timeout in milliseconds to wait for device at startup\&. During boot, devices may take a while to be detected by the driver\&. This property will cause to delay NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service and nm\-online to give the device a chance to appear\&. This works by waiting for the given timeout until a compatible device for the profile is available and managed\&. The value 0 means no wait time\&. The default value is \-1, which currently has the same meaning as no wait time\&.
.sp
Format: int32

\fBzone\fR
.RS 4
The trust level of a the connection\&. Free form case\-insensitive string (for example "Home", "Work", "Public")\&.

When using the path scheme, this property should be set to the full UTF\-8 encoded path of the certificate, prefixed with the string "file://" and ending with a terminating NUL byte\&. This property can be unset even if the EAP method supports CA certificates, but this allows man\-in\-the\-middle attacks and is NOT recommended\&.

If the property is not a hex string it is considered as a non\-hardware\-address client ID and the \*(Aqtype\*(Aq field is set to 0\&. The special values "mac" and "perm\-mac" are supported, which use the current or permanent MAC address of the device to generate a client identifier with type ethernet (01)\&. Currently, these options only work for ethernet type of links\&. The special value "ipv6\-duid" uses the DUID from "ipv6\&.dhcp\-duid" property as an RFC4361\-compliant client identifier\&. As IAID it uses "ipv4\&.dhcp\-iaid" and falls back to "ipv6\&.dhcp\-iaid" if unset\&.

\fBdns\-priority\fR
.RS 4
DNS servers priority\&. The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting\&. A lower numerical value is better (higher priority)\&. Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used\&. To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative value of all active connections profiles\&. Zero selects a globally configured default value\&. If the latter is missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for other connections\&. Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active connections\&. It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the same connection profile\&. When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default route and then all other devices\&. When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of resolv\&.conf\&. To prioritize a given server over another one within the same connection, just specify them in the desired order\&. Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv\&.conf in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure\&. See for example the "rotate" option of the dns\-options setting\&. If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices with that lowest priority will be considered\&. When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd\-resolved settings), each connection is used to query domains in its search list\&. The search domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize name servers based on the domain\&. Queries for domains not present in any search list are routed through connections having the \*(Aq~\&.\*(Aq special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route (or can be added manually)\&. When multiple connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins\&. If a sub domain is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the sub domain to be shadowed\&. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired interface are configured\&.

Note that if "may\-fail" is FALSE for the same address family, this property has no effect as NetworkManager needs to wait for the full DHCP timeout\&.

In order to try providing a stable DUID\-LLT, the time field will contain a constant timestamp that is used globally (for all profiles) and persisted to disk\&.

\fBdns\-priority\fR

DNS servers priority\&. The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting\&. A lower numerical value is better (higher priority)\&. Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used\&. To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative value of all active connections profiles\&. Zero selects a globally configured default value\&. If the latter is missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for other connections\&. Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active connections\&. It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the same connection profile\&. When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default route and then all other devices\&. When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of resolv\&.conf\&. To prioritize a given server over another one within the same connection, just specify them in the desired order\&. Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv\&.conf in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure\&. See for example the "rotate" option of the dns\-options setting\&. If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices with that lowest priority will be considered\&. When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd\-resolved settings), each connection is used to query domains in its search list\&. The search domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize name servers based on the domain\&. Queries for domains not present in any search list are routed through connections having the \*(Aq~\&.\*(Aq special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route (or can be added manually)\&. When multiple connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins\&. If a sub domain is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the sub domain to be shadowed\&. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired interface are configured\&.

\fBgenerate\-mac\-address\-mask\fR
.RS 4
With "cloned\-mac\-address" setting "random" or "stable", by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address is created\&. This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed\&. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address\&. If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting\&. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address\&. If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask\&. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization\&. Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or "stable" algorithm\&. If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized\&. For example, a value of "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized\&. A value of "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled globally\-administered, burned\-in MAC address\&. If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly\&. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered\&.

The fwmark number is also used as routing\-table for the default\-route, and if fwmark is zero, an unused fwmark/table is chosen automatically\&. This corresponds to what wg\-quick does with Table=auto and what WireGuard calls "Improved Rule\-based Routing"\&. Note that for this automatism to work, you usually don\*(Aqt want to set ipv4\&.gateway, because that will result in a conflicting default route\&. Leaving this at the default will enable this option automatically if ipv4\&.never\-default is not set and there are any peers that use a default\-route as allowed\-ips\&.

Beside explicitly specifying a MAC address, the special values "preserve", "permanent", "random" and "stable" are supported\&. "preserve" means not to touch the MAC address on activation\&. "permanent" means to use the permanent hardware address of the device\&. "random" creates a random MAC address on each connect\&. "stable" creates a hashed MAC address based on connection\&.stable\-id and a machine dependent key\&. If unspecified, the value can be overwritten via global defaults, see manual of NetworkManager\&.conf\&. If still unspecified, it defaults to "preserve" (older versions of NetworkManager may use a different default value)\&.

\fBgenerate\-mac\-address\-mask\fR
.RS 4
With "cloned\-mac\-address" setting "random" or "stable", by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address is created\&. This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed\&. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address\&. If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting\&. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address\&. If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask\&. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization\&. Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or "stable" algorithm\&. If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized\&. For example, a value of "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized\&. A value of "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled globally\-administered, burned\-in MAC address\&. If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly\&. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered\&.
